"""Cross-reference integrity check for the collected book.

Two failure modes here are SILENT — neither produces a "??" in the PDF, so
neither shows up in a normal build:

  * a \\label that never reaches the .aux. Observed with \\label placed
    immediately after \\begin{env}[...] — on the same line or the next one —
    for a theorem environment wrapped by \\tcolorboxenvironment. The statement
    still renders and still numbers correctly (the counter steps; only the
    write is lost), so nothing looks wrong until something tries to \\ref it.
    Moving the \\label a few words into the first sentence fixes it. Nearly
    every label in the book sits in the leading position and is fine, so this
    is not worth linting for statically — whether a given one survives seems to
    depend on how its box breaks across pages, which means an unrelated edit in
    the same chapter can knock one out. Run this check after any substantial
    edit, not just after adding labels.
  * a \\crosslecture{label}{text} pointing at a label that no longer exists.
    In the book \\crosslecture expands to \\hyperref, which quietly prints the
    text with no link rather than erroring.

Run after building. Exits non-zero if either is found.
